# Chicago-Crime-Data-Analysis

Welcome to our Chicago Crime Data Visualization project! In this repository, we harness the power of Tableau to create an immersive dashboard and scorecard that offers comprehensive insights into the crime landscape of Chicago from 2020 to 2023. Through dynamic visualizations and in-depth analysis, we aim to provide a user-friendly interface for exploring crime trends, patterns, and correlations. Dive into the data-driven narrative as we transform raw crime statistics into actionable information, fostering a better understanding of the evolving dynamics within the city. Explore the code, visualizations, and methodology to uncover the stories behind the numbers and contribute to a more informed perspective on Chicago's crime data.
